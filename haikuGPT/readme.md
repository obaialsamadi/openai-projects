# HaikuGPT

Ever wanted to create your own Haiku? Well you could go to ChatGPT and ask it to generate one for you, but this program does nothing but use openai to generate Haikus for you. 

## Running It

This is a Python program and requires some set up before running:
1) obtain your openai API key and paste in the .env file: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
2) run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required libraries
3) run the main.py file to be prompted for words to include in the Haiku

Once you hit enter, it'll output a Haiku that includes the words you'd want to be in it.

The more ridiculous the words, the funnier it can be. It can also be very poetic and deep in meaning; up to you!
